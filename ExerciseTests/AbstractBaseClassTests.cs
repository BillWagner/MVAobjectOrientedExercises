        // and determine if any of our classes should be abstract:
        // Are there types that are never instantiated?
        // Is that by design, or simply based on the features we’ve created so far?
        // Should any of the abstract types have abstract members?

        // So, there aren't any new features that warrant new tests. 
        // That's why this is an empty test file.
